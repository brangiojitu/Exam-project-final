            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>After apainful moment, the indifference of the manager decided to start his own business: he started from 11 euros, and today he donates part of the profit to charity</h2><br>
            <p>Perhaps Darius Jermila (31) would still be in paid employment today, if not for one unpleasant incident. When, after a hard day's work, Darius suddenly lost consciousness at home and found himself in the hospidal, he found out he had epilepsy. When he called the manager to ask for a day off, he heard what no one would expect in such a situation... After such an experience, D. Jarmala decided to realize a secretly cherished dream - to start a family buisness.</p><br>
            <div class="paragraph_2">
              <h1>Travel time - for books</h1>
              <p>Darius Jermala started his career working as an engineer in a large electrical network company, dreaming of moving up the carreer ladder.The man thinks that the company bus was transported to work in the comapny on the outskirts of Vilnius every day and the round trip took more then an hour.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph_3">
            <img class="photo2" src="/ExamPictures/pictures/images/304.jpg">
            <p>"While other colleagues were talking or sleeping, I read books. To others, I may have looked strange early in the winter morning or at dusk on the way home reading a book with a mini light, but i read about half a hundred books during my time on the bus.About economics, financial management, popular psychology, leadership.I already started dreaming about my busines, but I didin't have any specific plans,"says Darius.</p><br>
            <div class="para_4">
            <p>At the same time, the 24-year-old was studying for an engineering degree.He had already started a family, so it is no secret that work and study were quite a challenge at the same time. They left the house at about 6:430 a.m., and returned, about at 10p.m.He often went to economics seminars with his wife on weekends - he hoped that one day he would ned to knowledge.</p>
            <div class="para_5">
              <h3>"Are you sure you won't come to work?"</h3>
              <p>"It simply come to my notice then that i had apilepsy.The first attack occurred after a busy day, when i had to replace 2 more colleagues. I was at home and cutting vegetables.Iwas holding a large kitchen knife in my hand at the time, so it as all lucky that there was a wife nearby and it all ended without much trouble.I woke up in hospital.There was a lot of confusion - what happened? why right now ? What are the reasons for this? The well-being was worse than the worst hangovers I had experioenced in my youth.As soon as some of the forces returned ,I immediately decided to call the manager and ask for a day off, but when i describe the situation and how well I felt, the manager's question was shocking; "You really can't come to work?". It was the turning point when i realized that the job i was hiring was not for me, "Darius does not recall the most fond memories.</p>
              <div class="para_6">
                <p>After the incident, the man began to delve even deeper into the trading business. Due to financial obligations to the bank and the fact that the family did not have many savings, they could not quit their hired work, so they set up their own e-commerce store during their free time. The initial store was helped to create the basics of programming acquired during the studies and the advice of friends, because, as you know, everything in the field of IT is improving rapidly.</p>
                <div class="para_7">
                  <img class="photo3" src="/ExamPictures/pictures/images/201.jpg">
                  <h4>The profit is divided into 3 parts</h4>
                  <p>"The budget was very limited - the first basket of test goods we bought from suppliers was worth just 11 euros. The goods traveled a long time, but it was a lot of fun when the first purchases started. Selling a product for 1 euro gave me as much joy as selling it for 1,000 today, ” the interviewee smiles, remembering the start of the business a few years ago.</p>
                  <div class="para_8">
                    <p>The business was slowly moving forward, sales were growing, and time was running out. As soon as he started trading, Jermala became a member of the Economy of Communion, i.e. decided to divide its profits into three parts: one for the poor (non-profit organizations or deprived individuals), the other for education, and the third for business development.</p>
                    <div class="para_9">
                      <p>"We are the first members of the Community Economy in Lithuania. As soon as we have a profit, we always dedicate part of it to the sacrifice. We are happy to share our personal business experience with friends, ”says the businessman.</p>
                      <div class="para_10">
                        <h5>Getting started was not easy</h5>
                        <p>At the start of the business, the goods were stored at home - the man now with nostalgia and a smile remembers how they all fit in one closet, but at the time it seemed to be very numerous. And the customers who took the goods back came to the house, where they were delivered by the wife raising the baby. Darius still worked for an electrical network company.</p>><br>
                        <div class="para_11">
                        <p>"But it was a real challenge for my wife to find the right product, to consult people, because I knew all the information. Combining work with business development was becoming more and more difficult, so we decided to take risks and exchange places with my wife. "My son Mykolas was about 1.5 years old when his wife returned to work, and I left myself, took care of my son at home and started a business," she says.</p><br></div>
                        <div class="para_12">
                        <p>The man went to the post office and post offices with the baby every day to send parcels and pick up the ones received. This, art, was not an easy time. So it became easier when the little one started attending kindergarten and the businessman rented out the premises for trade more than two years ago.</p><br></div>
                        <div class="para_13">
                        <p>This helped to separate the work from the family and not to work because, as Darius says, there is never a shortage of work with his own business. Investments come from family funds, businesses are not growing by leaps and bounds, but there have been several breakthroughs when the workload has increased quite sharply. Darius once miscalculated his workload and the client found him lying on the ground in the office after a recent epileptic seizure that was difficult to navigate in the environment. The customer did not get lost, called an ambulance, and the next day returned and purchased the desired product.</p><br></div>
                        <div class="para_14">
                          <img class="photo4" src="/ExamPictures/pictures/images/203.jpg">
                          <h6>Looking for the best</h6>
                          <p>"People often ask why we have such different goods. I answer them that we trade what we have tried ourselves and can recommend. I am a bike lover, so I searched for and found quality and inexpensive bike accessories. His wife is an enthusiast of a healthy lifestyle - so we found quality essential oils, diffusers, natural food supplements. To make my wife happy, I grow pea seedlings, onion leaves and other vegetables in the office, even in the dark of the year, using LED bulbs. With this example, I show my customers that even an inexperienced grower can grow vegetables at home in any season, ” the businessman smiles.</p><br>
                          <div class="para_15">
                           <p> And when customers ask why the business name Duper.it was chosen, Darius' answer is short: "I want the customer to have an association with super product quality, super service and superfast delivery."<br></p></div>
                           <div class="para_16">
                           <p> And since Darius' eldest son has already expressed a desire to take over the Duper.it business in the future, it is a great motivation for the husband to try and grow the business.<br></p></div>
